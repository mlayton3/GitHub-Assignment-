<h2>Director </h2>
	<p> Welcome to Little Wonders Learning Center! I am so excited about this new adventure that I am taking on! I have had many different experiences in child care. I have worked at many different daycares in town. I will graduate with my Business degreee from Peru State College in May. I have my associates degree in Early Childhood Education. I have seen that childcare is a need for this community. There are so many families that need childcare and I can't wait for them to be apart of mine.
